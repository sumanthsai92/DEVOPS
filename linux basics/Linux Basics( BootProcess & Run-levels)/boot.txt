Boot Process :

BIOS

MBR

GRUB

KERNEL

INIT/SYSTEMD

RUNLEVELS/TARGETS


There are six high-level stages for Linux boot process:


BIOS – Basic Input/Output System executes MBR

MBR – Master Boot Record execute GRUB

GRUB – Grand Unified Bootloader executes Kernel

Kernel – Kernel executes /sbin/init

Init – Init executes runlevel programs

Runlevel – Runlevel programs are executed from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/


Runlevels :

There are seven(7) run levels available with the Linux operating system:


0 – halt

1 – single-user mode

2 – Multiuser, without NFS

3 – Full multiuser mode

4 – unused

5 – X11

6 – reboot



Check the Runlevel In Linux (Systemd)

In recent versions of Linux systems (starting from RHEL 7, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), the concept of runlevels has been replaced with systemd targets.


Here is the list of Systemd targets in Linux distributions,which were distributed with Systemd as default service manager.


runlevel0.target, poweroff.target - Halt

runlevel1.target, rescue.target - Single-user text mode

runlevel2.target, multi-user.target - Not used (user-definable)

runlevel3.target, multi-user.target - Full multi-user text mode

runlevel4.target, multi-user.target - Not used (user-definable)

runlevel5.target, graphical.target - Full multi-user graphical mode (with an X-based login screen)

runlevel6.target, reboot.target - Reboot


In Linux systems that are using Systemd as default service manager, you can find the current target using command:


$ systemctl get-default


To view all currently loaded targets, run:


$ systemctl list-units --type target


If you'd like to change the RunLevel to something else, for example runlevel3.target, set it as shown below:


$ sudo systemctl set-default runlevel3.target


Check Linux Runlevel Using 'who' command

As one of the reader suggested in the comment section below, we can also find the runlevel using who command like below:


$ who -r


To find out the system runlevel, open your Terminal and run the following command:


$ runlevel


$ systemctl get-default

$ systemctl set-default "multi-user.target"


If you'd like to change the RunLevel to something else, edit /etc/inittab file:


$ sudo vi /etc/inittab


For more details about runlevels, refer man pages.


$ man runlevel
